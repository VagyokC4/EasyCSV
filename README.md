EasyCSV
=======

Fast, zero-config CSV reader in one source file that can be included in a .Net Project

Based on my CSV Reader initially posted to this Stack Overflow question:
http://stackoverflow.com/a/1544743/3043

Roadmap to 1.0:

.1 Initial upload
.2 Add Visual Studio solution with Unit Tests
.3 Convert to inherit from TextReader
.4 Add options: delimiter, error handling, escaping
.5 Add support for projecting records to a POCO instead of a List<string>
.6 Initial write support
.7 Refine write support
